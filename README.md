# Hangman-Game-w-Python-Turtle

This project allows the user to play Hangman either against a friend or against the CPU in an IDE's console (that supports Python Turtle). If this project is ran in Replit,
for example, then this project will function correctly because Replit supports Python Turtle. The user inputs into the console, and based on the user's input the Python
Turtle draws on-screen. 

NOTE: Make sure the Python Turtle window is in full-screen mode, so you can see what the Python Turtle is drawing for the Hangman game. You might have to adjust your
      window size, so you can see everything that the Python Turtle is drawing. Also, make sure you listen to the input instructions precisely! Otherwise, a while loop
      will run endlessly prompting the same thing over and over until you listen to the instructions in the console.
      
Have fun!
